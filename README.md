# Uncovering Malicious Apps Through User Feedback: A Machine Learning Approach

This project analyzes user feedback to identify potentially malicious apps using machine learning. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to distinguish between safe and malicious apps based on user reviews and app metadata.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rohitprofc/malicious-app-detector.git
    cd malicious-app-detector
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Make sure you have a Jupyter notebook environment or run the provided `.ipynb` file using your preferred Python IDE.

## Files Overview

- `code.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `googleplaystore.csv`: The dataset containing information about apps in the Google Play Store.
- `googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv`: The dataset containing user reviews for the apps in the Play Store.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `code.ipynb` to explore the project, perform the analysis, and train the model. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.
